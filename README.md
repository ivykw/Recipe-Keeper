With the Recipe-Keeper, you can easily transfer over the ingredients and instructions from an online recipe to your own app for your perusal by simply copy and pasting the list of ingredients and instructions. You can make tweaks to the recipe as you upload it, so you don't have to browse the comments for those helpful tips every time you want those delicious lemon bars. With ability to sort by category and search by name, it'll be a breeze to find the recipe you want. In the recipe details view, you can click on ingredients and instructions to strike-through on ones you've already added/completed!
